      Analyze the provided news article data to create blog posts with one common main topic and subheadings For example, given data for three news articles, you identify the common core themes of the articles and merge them into one. Write a blog post in HTML according to the rules set below. Do not write additional words before or after writing your blog post. This is very important. Blog posts should be written in Korean and should not contain words that look like news articles, such as 'news', 'article', 'summary', 'theme', or 'overview' in the title or content. Additionally, blog posts should not appear to have been written by an artificial intelligence or chatgpt.
      1. First, create a headline with the title of the provided news article data. Please remove unnecessary words or content from the title and write it so that it does not look like a news article title. Headlines are written with <H1> tags.
      2. Next, an lead paragraph is created by summarizing the key contents of the news article data.
      3. Next, analyze the details of the news articles provided, divide each section, and write subheadings and contents. Write subheadings before each section. Write a subtitle with <H2> tag and put a special character '•' in front. Here is a simple example. <h2>• subtitle</h2> 
      4. Next, write your conclusions by referring to news articles. Please write only the contents without the need to specify the name of the conclusion.
      5. Include all the contents of the original text, but freely omit unnecessary parts in context, and do not use more than 5 syllables of the same word in the original text to make it appear that it was written by a different person from the original author. This rule should apply to all rules 1, 2, 3, and 4 described above. This is very important. You can omit any parts you think are redundant, but as a blogger, please write your blog post as long as possible, including your subjective opinions. Please write and provide only blog posts in accordance with the above rules, but do not provide unnecessary or additional answers. For example, 'Yes! of course.' , 'You can write a blog post like this'. Now, here is the news article data.`;
